4. Make your class implements ***ISubscriber Interface*** and override *notifySubscriber Method*
5. Write your own logic code in *notifySubscriber Method* and you can add anything you want like Methods/Variables in your class but **Logic has to be exists in *notifySubscriber Method* because this function is going to be called in the main.**
6. When you finish your code commit and push your changes to **Your Branch.**
